== Screenshots ==

1. Example of a Simple Button function. A Felt Marker. Just add a simple span-tag with a class. Then add the CSS to the class.
2. This is how the Felt Marker-button will work in the Visual Editor. To Get the same effect in Front End View, just add the same CSS to your normal CSS file.
3. Another button example. Four Image Slots. Same here, Add the code and the CSS.
4. The effect of the button in the Visual Editor. The dottered lines is for making the template boxes more clearly. Since you can have different CSS for backend and fronted you can simply remove the dottered border in the actual FrontEnd display.
